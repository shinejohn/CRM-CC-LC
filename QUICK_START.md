## ⚠️ Note About API Calls

**The backend API isn't running yet**, so:
- Some API calls will fail (this is expected)
- The UI will still load and display
- You can navigate and see the interface
- Data won't load until AWS is deployed

**This is normal - you can still view and test the UI!**

---

## 🛑 To Stop

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the dev server.

---

**That's it! Just run `npm install` then `npm run dev`** 🎉
