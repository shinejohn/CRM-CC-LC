## SLIDE 1: Hook
**Component:** HeroSlide
**Audio File:** slide-01-hook.mp3
**Duration:** 10 seconds

### Visual:
Split screen:
- Left: Black & white image of 1970s Main Street, busy, alive
- Right: Same street today, empty storefronts

### Text:
**"Your parents had it easy."**

### Narration:
"Your parents didn't need to be marketers. They had something you don't. Let me show you what happened."

---

## SLIDE 2: The Old World
**Component:** ConceptSlide
**Audio File:** slide-02-old-world.mp3
**Duration:** 90 seconds

### Visual:
Four quadrant layout:
- Newspaper (icon + "Everyone read it")
- Yellow Pages (icon + "Everyone used it")
- Local Radio (icon + "Everyone heard it")
- Local TV News (icon + "Everyone watched it")

Center: "SHARED COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE"

### Text:
**"Marketing used to be simple: Show up where people look."**

### Narration:
"In your parents' day, there was infrastructure. One newspaper the whole town read. One Yellow Pages by every phone. Local radio everyone listened to on their commute. Evening news that families gathered around.

Everyone was connected to the same sources. A business owner's job was simple: show up where people already gathered. The infrastructure did the work. You just had to plug in."

---

## SLIDE 3: The Collapse - Newspapers
**Component:** DataSlide
**Audio File:** slide-03-newspapers.mp3
**Duration:** 90 seconds

### Visual:
- Large number: "2,200+"
- Subtext: "newspapers closed since 2005"
- Declining graph: Ad revenue $49B → $9B
- Map showing "news deserts"

### Text:
**"The community bulletin board was ripped off the wall."**

### Narration:
"Two thousand two hundred newspapers have closed since 2005. Advertising revenue collapsed from forty-nine billion to nine billion dollars. Eighteen hundred communities have no local news coverage at all.

Craigslist killed classifieds. Google and Facebook vacuumed up the ad dollars. Private equity bought papers and gutted them.

Your ad in the newspaper today? Nobody sees it. Because barely anyone reads it. Because there's barely a paper left."

---

## SLIDE 4: The Collapse - Radio & TV
**Component:** DataSlide
**Audio File:** slide-04-radio-tv.mp3
**Duration:** 90 seconds

### Visual:
- iHeart/Sinclair logos with station counts
- "850+ stations" / "185 stations"
- Icon of DJ crossed out
- Icon of local reporter crossed out

### Text:
**"The local voices were silenced."**

### Narration:
"iHeartMedia owns over eight hundred radio stations. Local DJs fired. Local programming eliminated. That morning show your parents loved? It's a pre-recorded voice from Texas, pretending to be local.

Sinclair owns one hundred eighty-five TV stations—the same scripts read in different cities. Local investigative journalism? Gone. Local reporters? Laid off.

The community's soundtrack and campfire were replaced with corporate content."

---

## SLIDE 5: The Collapse - Yellow Pages & Downtown
**Component:** DataSlide
**Audio File:** slide-05-yellowpages-downtown.mp3
**Duration:** 90 seconds

### Visual:
- Yellow Pages book with "recycling" arrow
- Revenue: $14B → $2B
- Empty Main Street storefronts
- Foot traffic down 40-60%

### Text:
**"The places people gathered disappeared."**

### Narration:
"Yellow Pages revenue collapsed from fourteen billion to under two billion. Most copies go straight to recycling, unopened. Average user age: sixty-five.

And downtown? Walmart came first. Then Amazon finished the job. Main Street went from the community's living room to a row of empty storefronts.

Your sign in the window? Nobody walks by to see it. The living room is empty."

---

## SLIDE 6: The Void
**Component:** TransitionSlide
**Audio File:** slide-06-void.mp3
**Duration:** 60 seconds

### Visual:
Dark background
Center text, appearing word by word:
"No newspaper."
"No radio."
"No TV news."
"No phone book."
"No downtown."
"NO INFRASTRUCTURE."

### Text:
**"You were left with nothing."**

### Narration:
"By 2020, small business owners were left in a void. No newspaper that people read. No radio with local voices. No TV news covering the community. No phone book anyone uses. No downtown anyone visits.

The infrastructure that made marketing simple was gone. And nothing real replaced it."

---

## SLIDE 7: The False Promise
**Component:** ComparisonSlide
**Audio File:** slide-07-false-promise.mp3
**Duration:** 90 seconds

### Visual:
Two columns:
**"They Said"** | **"Reality"**
Build a website → 96% get zero traffic
Social media is free → 1-2% organic reach
SEO gets you found → Algorithm changes 500x/year
Digital ads work → $2-5 per click, most don't convert

### Text:
**"You were told to become your own media company."**

### Narration:
"'Go digital!' they said. Build a website. Do SEO. Post on social media. Run ads. Be everywhere.

They didn't tell you: Ninety-six percent of websites get zero traffic from Google. Facebook shows your posts to one percent of your followers. Google changes its algorithm five hundred times a year. Digital ads burn through money with nothing to show.

You weren't given a new opportunity. You were given an impossible job."

---

## SLIDE 8: The Arsonists
**Component:** ConceptSlide
**Audio File:** slide-08-arsonists.mp3
**Duration:** 90 seconds

### Visual:
Three columns with brand logos:
- Google: "Killed Yellow Pages → Sells Google Ads"
- Facebook: "Killed organic reach → Sells Facebook Ads"
- Amazon: "Killed Main Street → Charges marketplace fees"

Footer: "You're paying the people who created the problem."

### Text:
**"The arsonists are selling fire insurance."**

### Narration:
"Here's the part that should make you angry.

Google helped kill the Yellow Pages and newspapers by taking all the ad money. Now Google sells you Google Ads.

Facebook promised free marketing, then killed organic reach. Now Facebook sells you Facebook Ads.

Amazon killed Main Street. Now they charge you to sell on their platform.

They burned down the building. Now they're selling you fire insurance."

---

## SLIDE 9: What Never Changed
**Component:** HeroSlide
**Audio File:** slide-09-never-changed.mp3
**Duration:** 90 seconds

### Visual:
Warm image of community—farmers market, local event, people gathered
Text overlays appearing:
"They still want local news."
"They still want local businesses."
"They still want community."
"They still want home."

### Text:
**"The people never changed."**

### Narration:
"But here's what everyone forgets.

The infrastructure was destroyed. But the people? They never changed.

They still want to know what's happening in town. They still want to find good local businesses. They still want to support their neighbors. They still want to feel like they belong somewhere.

They still want home.

The community didn't die. The connective tissue did."

---

## SLIDE 10: The Rebuild
**Component:** ComparisonSlide
**Audio File:** slide-10-rebuild.mp3
**Duration:** 90 seconds

### Visual:
Two columns with connecting arrows:
**"What Died"** → **"What We Built"**
Local Newspaper → Digital News (DN)
Yellow Pages → Directory (DTG)
Bulletin Board → Events Calendar (GEC)
Community Hub → Alphasite
Marketing Staff → AI Services

### Text:
**"We're rebuilding the infrastructure."**

### Narration:
"We're not building another marketing tool. We're rebuilding what was destroyed.

The newspaper is now a digital news platform people actually read. The Yellow Pages is now a directory people actually use. The bulletin board is now an events calendar people actually check. And the marketing department you couldn't afford? That's now AI that works for you.

Your parents plugged into infrastructure. Now you can too."

---

## SLIDE 11: Your Job Again
**Component:** ActionSlide
**Audio File:** slide-11-your-job.mp3
**Duration:** 60 seconds

### Visual:
Simple, clean design
Center text: "SHOW UP"
Below: Four icons representing claiming listing, posting event, sharing news, getting featured

### Text:
**"Just like your parents. But built for today."**

### Narration:
"Remember how simple it was for your parents? Show up in the paper. Show up in the Yellow Pages. Show up where people look.

That's your job again. Claim your listing. Post your events. Share your news. Let the infrastructure do what infrastructure does.

You focus on your business. We make sure people find you."

---

## SLIDE 12: Call to Action
**Component:** CTASlide
**Audio File:** slide-12-cta.mp3
**Duration:** 60 seconds

### Visual:
Clean, inviting design
Primary CTA button: "Claim Your Free Listing"
Secondary: "See How It Works"
Footer: "It takes 5 minutes. Just like the Yellow Pages. But better."

### Text:
**"The community is still here. The people still care. Welcome to Fibonacco."**

### Narration:
"The community is still here. The people still care. The infrastructure just needed to be rebuilt.

Claim your free listing. It takes five minutes. You'll be visible in the directory, findable by people looking for what you offer, and connected to the community again.

Welcome to Fibonacco. Welcome back to being found."

## Audio Production Notes

### Tone Guidance for Voice Actor:

### Music Suggestion:
