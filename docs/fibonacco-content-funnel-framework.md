## PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

For each topic, produce in this order:

```
1. ARTICLE FIRST
   - Write the long-form story version
   - This forces clarity on the concept
   - Extract key points for presentation
   
2. PRESENTATION SECOND
   - Distill article to 5-7 slides
   - One key insight per slide
   - Hook, problem, insight, implication, CTA
   
3. HOW-TO THIRD
   - Translate insight into action
   - Step-by-step format
   - Specific, practical, time-bound
   
4. HOOK FOURTH
   - Create templates for personalization
   - Build automated or semi-automated delivery
   - Pre-populate with prospect data
   
5. EMAILS LAST
   - Once content exists, write emails that drive to it
   - A/B test subject lines
   - Set up sequences in CRM
```
