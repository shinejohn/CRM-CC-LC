# CSSN Social Syndication — Add-On Product Spec
### Fibonacco Command Center | Revenue Layer & Client Tools
**Version 1.0 | February 2026**

---

## Overview: What This Is and What It Is Not

The Community Social Syndication Network (CSSN) serves two distinct functions that need to be understood separately before any product packaging is designed.

**Function 1 — Fibonacco's own community brand presence.** Fibonacco operates branded social accounts (Tampa Day News, Downtown Clearwater Guide, Go Event Sarasota) across every community. This is infrastructure — it exists to build Fibonacco's audience, distribute content, and create a media footprint. It is not billable to SMB clients directly. It is a platform asset.

**Function 2 — SMB content distribution through Fibonacco's channels.** When an SMB's coupon, event, or announcement gets distributed through Fibonacco's community social channels, that distribution has real value — it's reach the SMB would otherwise have to pay a social media agency $2,000–5,000/month to approximate. This is the billable layer.

**Function 3 — Client self-posting tools.** Fibonacco's AI content creation pipeline — the Visual Event Format Creator, the Copy Generator, the Asset Processor — can be surfaced to SMB clients as tools they use to create content for their own social accounts, independent of Fibonacco's distribution network. This is an entirely separate product that monetizes the same underlying AI infrastructure at very low marginal cost.

This document covers the packaging and pricing for Functions 2 and 3 as client-facing add-on products.

## Product 1: CSSN Distribution Add-On

### What It Is

An add-on to any active Fibonacco SMB subscription that gives the SMB's content — coupons, events, articles, announcements — priority distribution through Fibonacco's community social channels. Without the add-on, SMB content may be included in community distribution at Fibonacco's editorial discretion. With the add-on, it is guaranteed, scheduled, and reported on.

### Tiers

**CSSN Local — $49/month**
Guaranteed distribution of all SMB-created content through the community's Tier 1 social channels (Facebook, Instagram, Google Business Profile, Reddit). Content is included in standard posting rotation. Monthly performance report showing impressions, reach, and engagement attributable to the SMB's content. Suitable for single-location businesses focused on their home community.

**CSSN Reach — $99/month**
Everything in Local, plus Tier 2 platform distribution (X, Pinterest, YouTube Shorts, Snapchat event cards, Medium for eligible articles). Visual Event Format Creator activated — all SMB events get Instagram and Snapchat card treatment automatically. Priority placement in the community posting queue — SMB content posts before non-subscriber content. Bi-weekly performance report with platform-by-platform breakdown.

**CSSN Network — $199/month**
Everything in Reach, plus cross-community syndication. SMB content is distributed across up to 5 adjacent communities in addition to the home community. Full Tier 3 platform distribution for eligible metro communities. Inclusion eligibility for the Signature Series Local Discovery feature (editorial, not guaranteed). Weekly performance report with competitive engagement context. Dedicated CSSN support through the AI Account Manager.

**CSSN Enterprise — Custom Pricing**
For multi-location businesses, franchise groups, and regional brands. Content distributed across all relevant communities in the Fibonacco network. Custom posting schedules, brand voice configuration, and dedicated content strategy support. Custom analytics dashboard with location-by-location attribution. Suitable for regional chains, healthcare groups, hospitality brands, and municipal clients.

### Campaign Add-On vs. Community Subscription

CSSN distribution can be purchased in two modes:

**Subscription mode** (above tiers) — ongoing monthly distribution across all content the SMB creates. Best for businesses with consistent content output: restaurants posting weekly specials, event venues posting regular lineups, retailers running seasonal promotions.

**Campaign mode** — one-time CSSN burst tied to a specific campaign. A business running a 30-day promotion purchases CSSN Campaign distribution for that window only, at 1.5× the monthly rate with no ongoing commitment. Best for seasonal businesses, product launches, grand openings, and event-specific pushes. Campaign mode is available as a standalone purchase inside the Command Center without requiring a subscription upgrade.

### Content Reuse and the Syndication Dividend

A key value proposition of the CSSN add-on is that content created once inside the Command Center gets distributed many times across many platforms. The SMB does not create separate content for each platform — the AI Adaptation Layer handles all reformatting. An SMB that creates one coupon gets that coupon distributed as a Facebook post, an Instagram post, a Google offer, a Reddit-eligible editorial mention (if it passes the editorial filter), a Pinterest pin, and a Snap Map event card, automatically.

This "syndication dividend" — the ratio of distribution instances to creation effort — is the core metric Fibonacco uses to demonstrate value in CSSN reporting. A single piece of content distributed across 8 platforms and 5 communities represents 40 individual posts from 1 creation action. That's the number that goes on the monthly report.

## Product 2: Fibonacco Social Studio (Client Self-Posting Tools)

### What It Is

Social Studio is a self-service AI content creation tool, accessible from inside the Command Center, that SMB clients use to create social media content for their own accounts — not Fibonacco's community accounts. It is powered by the same AI pipeline that drives CSSN: the Copy Generator, the Visual Event Format Creator, and the Asset Processor. The SMB uses these tools to produce platform-ready content, then downloads the assets or connects their own social accounts to post directly.

This is the "coin-operated" model applied to Fibonacco's AI infrastructure. SMBs pay for what they create. They don't pay for what they don't use.

### The Self-Posting Value Proposition

Every SMB client already has their own Facebook page, Instagram account, and Google Business Profile. They struggle to create consistent, professional content for these accounts not because they lack ideas but because they lack time, design skills, and platform-specific knowledge. Social Studio gives them:

A copy generator that understands their business profile, voice, and audience. An event card creator that produces professional Instagram and Snapchat visuals from event data in under 60 seconds. A coupon card creator for Facebook and Instagram. A Google Business Profile post composer. A multi-platform content calendar that shows what to post, when to post it, and generates the content on demand. Direct scheduling to their connected social accounts, so they create inside the Command Center and the post goes live on their own pages.

The Fibonacco advantage here is the business profile context. Social Studio isn't a generic AI copywriter. It knows this business — their industry, their FAQs, their seasonal patterns, their tone from past content, their customer demographics from the Command Center CRM. That context produces copy that sounds like the business, not like AI-generated filler.

### Credit System: Coin-Operated Pricing

Social Studio operates on a credit system. Credits are purchased inside the Command Center and consumed per creative action. Different actions consume different credit amounts based on the complexity and AI compute cost of the underlying generation.

**Credit Costs per Action:**

| Action | Credits |
|---|---|
| Social media post copy (any platform) | 1 credit |
| Event card — single platform | 2 credits |
| Event card — full set (Instagram + Snap) | 3 credits |
| Coupon card — single platform | 2 credits |
| Google Business Profile post | 1 credit |
| Medium article repackage | 5 credits |
| Multi-platform content calendar (7 days) | 8 credits |
| Multi-platform content calendar (30 days) | 20 credits |
| Hashtag research pack | 1 credit |
| Competitor post analysis | 3 credits |

**Credit Packages:**

| Package | Credits | Price | Per-Credit Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Starter | 25 credits | $15 | $0.60 |
| Standard | 100 credits | $49 | $0.49 |
| Pro | 300 credits | $119 | $0.40 |
| Studio | 1,000 credits | $299 | $0.30 |

Credits never expire. Auto-replenishment can be enabled at any threshold. Unused credits roll over month to month. No subscription required — a business can purchase credits once and use them whenever they want. This is intentional: the frictionless, no-commitment entry point maximizes trial and reduces adoption resistance.

**Subscription Alternative:** SMBs who use Social Studio consistently can opt into a Social Studio Subscription at $79/month, which includes 200 credits per month plus a 20% discount on additional credit purchases. This converts coin-operated users into recurring revenue.

### Direct Scheduling Integration

Social Studio connects to the SMB's own social accounts via OAuth — the same token-based connection used by CSSN, but scoped to the SMB's personal accounts rather than Fibonacco's community accounts. The SMB authenticates their Facebook Page, Instagram Business Account, Google Business Profile, and X account once. After that, any content created in Social Studio can be scheduled to post directly to those accounts from inside the Command Center.

This is the full loop: the SMB opens Social Studio, generates a post, previews it, schedules it, and it publishes — all without leaving the Command Center and without logging into any social platform.

### Content Reuse: One Creation, Many Outputs

Social Studio is explicitly designed around content reuse. The SMB creates a single piece of source content — a weekly special, an event, a product announcement — and Social Studio generates all platform-specific variants from that single input.

The workflow: the SMB enters their content brief (what it is, key details, tone, any specific message). Social Studio generates a full multi-platform content pack: Facebook post copy, Instagram caption with hashtags, Google Business post, X post, and if it's an event, Instagram and Snapchat cards. All variants are shown side by side in a preview interface. The SMB reviews, adjusts any variant they want, then schedules all of them in one action. One brief → seven posts → zero additional work.

This content pack approach is the key differentiator from generic social AI tools. Other tools generate one post at a time. Social Studio generates a coordinated multi-platform campaign from a single brief, using the SMB's known voice and the community context from their Fibonacco profile.

### The CSSN + Social Studio Bundle

Clients who subscribe to both CSSN distribution and Social Studio get the strongest possible value: Fibonacco distributes their content through community channels, and the SMB simultaneously posts to their own accounts using AI-generated content. The same event, the same coupon, the same announcement — hitting the community audience through Fibonacco's channels and hitting the SMB's own follower base through their own accounts, with coordinated timing.

This bundle is positioned as "Complete Social Coverage" and priced at CSSN Reach ($99) + Social Studio Subscription ($79) with a 20% bundle discount = $142/month, compared to $178 a la carte.
