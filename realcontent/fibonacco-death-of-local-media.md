# The Death of Local Media
## The Story Nobody Tells Small Business Owners

**Document Purpose:** This is the foundational narrative that explains WHY everything is broken. This comes BEFORE the "marketing doesn't work" content. This is the "what happened to the world" piece.

## The Story Arc

### Your Parents Had It Easy

**The 1970s-1990s Small Business Playbook:**

Your parents (or grandparents) opened a business and marketing was simple:

1. **Take out an ad in the local newspaper** - Everyone read it. Everyone saw your ad. The newspaper was the community bulletin board.

2. **Buy a Yellow Pages listing** - When someone needed a plumber, they opened the book. Being there meant being found.

3. **Run a spot on local radio** - The morning DJ everyone listened to would read your ad. People heard it on their commute.

4. **Sponsor the local news** - "This broadcast brought to you by Johnson's Hardware." The whole town watched the same 6 o'clock news.

5. **Put a sign in your window** - Foot traffic was real. Downtown was alive. People walked by and walked in.

**Why it worked:**

There was **community media infrastructure**. 

- One newspaper everyone read
- One or two radio stations everyone listened to
- Three TV channels everyone watched
- One phone book everyone used
- A downtown everyone visited

**The business owner's job was simple:** Show up in the places everyone already looked.

The infrastructure did the work. The community was connected through shared media. You just had to plug in.

### Then It All Disappeared

**The Collapse (1995-2020):**

**Newspapers:**
- 2,200 newspapers have closed since 2005
- Newspaper ad revenue dropped from $49 billion (2006) to $9 billion (2022)
- Local news deserts: 1,800 communities have no local news coverage
- The papers that survive are shells - skeleton crews, wire stories, no local coverage
- Your ad in the newspaper? Nobody's reading it because nobody's reading the newspaper.

**Local Radio:**
- Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia) bought 1,200 stations and gutted local programming
- Local DJs replaced by syndicated national shows
- Local news eliminated in favor of automated playlists
- The morning show your parents listened to? It's a robot now, broadcasting from a server farm in Texas.

**Local TV News:**
- Sinclair Broadcasting owns 185 stations - same script, different city
- Local investigative journalism: nearly extinct
- "Local" news is now 10 minutes of weather, 10 minutes of crime, and national feeds
- The 6 o'clock news your parents watched? It's background noise now. Nobody's paying attention.

**Yellow Pages:**
- Revenue dropped from $14 billion (2007) to under $2 billion today
- 70% of Yellow Pages go directly from doorstep to recycling bin
- Average age of Yellow Pages user: 65+
- When's the last time YOU opened a phone book?

**Downtown:**
- Big box stores hollowed out main streets
- Amazon finished the job
- Foot traffic died
- The sign in your window? Nobody walks by to see it.

### What Replaced It? Nothing Good.

**The False Promise:**

When local media died, small business owners were told: "Go digital!"

- Build a website!
- Get on social media!
- Do SEO!
- Run Google Ads!
- Be everywhere online!

**The Reality:**

The internet didn't replace local media infrastructure. It **fragmented** it into a million pieces that nobody can navigate.

| Old World | "New World" |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1 newspaper everyone read | 10,000 websites nobody reads |
| 1 phone book | Google (controlled by algorithms you can't beat) |
| 3 TV channels | Infinite streaming (no shared experience) |
| Local radio | Spotify/podcasts (no local content) |
| Community gathering | Facebook groups (algorithmic chaos) |

**The Void:**

There is no longer shared community media infrastructure.

There is no place where "everyone looks."

There is no simple way to "show up" and be found.

**Your parents plugged into infrastructure that existed.**

**You were told to build your own infrastructure from scratch.**

That's not marketing. That's an impossible job.

---

### The DIY Trap

**What They Told You:**

"You need to become your own media company."

- Create content
- Build an audience
- Manage multiple platforms
- Learn SEO
- Master social media algorithms
- Run paid ads
- Analyze data
- Optimize funnels
- And also... run your actual business

**What Actually Happened:**

- You built a website nobody visits
- You posted on social media to crickets
- You tried SEO and got nowhere
- You spent money on ads that didn't work
- You got exhausted and gave up
- Or you keep grinding, hoping something changes

**The Cruel Joke:**

The same companies that destroyed local media (Google, Facebook, Amazon) now sell you "solutions" to the problem they created.

- Google killed the Yellow Pages, then charged you for Google Ads
- Facebook killed organic reach, then charged you for Facebook Ads
- Amazon killed downtown, then charged you to sell on their marketplace

**You're paying the arsonists for fire insurance.**

---

### The Real Problem

It's not that you're bad at marketing.

It's not that you haven't tried hard enough.

It's not that you need better tactics.

**The infrastructure your parents relied on was destroyed, and nothing replaced it.**

You're trying to do something impossible:
- Build your own media company
- While running your actual business
- Competing against corporations with unlimited resources
- On platforms designed to extract your money

**This is not a fair fight. It was never meant to be.**

## The Fibonacco Story

### We're Rebuilding What Was Lost

**The Origin:**

We didn't set out to build a "marketing platform."

We set out to answer a question: **What if we rebuilt local media infrastructure for the digital age?**

What if there was:
- A local news platform people actually read
- A business directory people actually use
- An events calendar people actually check
- A community hub people actually visit

Not another marketing tool that puts the burden on the business owner.

**Actual infrastructure** that does what the newspaper, radio station, and Yellow Pages used to do.

**The Vision:**

| What Died | What We Built |
|-----------|---------------|
| Local newspaper | Digital community news (DN) |
| Yellow Pages | Local business directory (DTG) |
| Community bulletin board | Events calendar (GEC) |
| Local radio/TV sponsors | Targeted community advertising |
| Word of mouth | Community social networks |

**The Difference:**

Your parents didn't have to "do marketing." They just showed up in the infrastructure.

**We're giving you infrastructure to show up in again.**

- The impossible job you were given
- The companies profiting from the chaos they created

## Voice Notes for This Content

### Tone: Empathetic Historian

We're not blaming anyone. We're explaining what happened.

**Like a wise friend saying:**
"Let me tell you what actually happened to the world while everyone was telling you to 'go digital.'"

**Not like a salesperson saying:**
"Everything you're doing is wrong! Buy our thing!"

### Key Phrases:

✅ "Your parents had it easy - and that's not a criticism of you"
✅ "The infrastructure was destroyed. You were left to build your own."
✅ "This isn't your fault. The game changed and nobody told you."
✅ "We're rebuilding what was lost."

❌ "You're doing it wrong"
❌ "Traditional marketing is dead" (too salesy)
❌ "We're disrupting..." (tech bro nonsense)
❌ "The only solution..." (too pushy)

## The One-Sentence Version

**For when someone asks "What is Fibonacco?"**

"We're rebuilding the local media infrastructure that was destroyed - the newspaper, the Yellow Pages, the community bulletin board - so small businesses can show up and be found again, without having to become their own marketing department."

---

## The Bumper Sticker Version

**Your parents had infrastructure. You got left with nothing. We're rebuilding it.**
