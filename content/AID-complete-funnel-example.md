# PART 1: THE PRESENTATION
## "How People Find Businesses Now"

**Specs:**
- 6 slides
- ~2.5 minutes total
- Hook → Problem → Insight → Implication → Action → CTA

---

### SLIDE 1: HOOK
**Duration:** 8 seconds
**Visual:** Split screen - person typing into Google (faded/old) vs. person talking to phone/AI (bright/current)

**Text on Screen:**
> "When's the last time you scrolled through Google results?"

**Narration:**
"Quick question: When's the last time you actually scrolled through Google search results to find a local business? Think about it."

---

### SLIDE 2: THE SHIFT
**Duration:** 25 seconds
**Visual:** Simple graphic showing transition: Google → ChatGPT/Siri/Alexa

**Text on Screen:**
> "Google it" → "Hey AI..."
> 
> 40% of Gen Z uses TikTok or AI for search
> AI assistants processed 8 billion queries last month

**Narration:**
"Something's changed. 'Google it' is becoming 'Hey ChatGPT' or 'Hey Siri, find me a...' 

Forty percent of Gen Z doesn't even use Google for search anymore. And AI assistants processed eight billion queries last month. That number doubles every year."

---

### SLIDE 3: HOW AI FINDS BUSINESSES
**Duration:** 35 seconds
**Visual:** Simple diagram showing AI "brain" pulling from: News sources, Directories, Reviews, Active businesses

**Text on Screen:**
> AI doesn't search—AI knows.
> 
> It learns from:
> ✓ Trusted news sources
> ✓ Business directories  
> ✓ Reviews & reputation
> ✓ Active, current information

**Narration:**
"Here's what most business owners don't understand: AI doesn't search the web in real-time like Google. AI already knows things. It's been trained on trusted sources—news publications, business directories, reviews, reputation signals.

When someone asks AI for a recommendation, AI already has an answer. The question is: are you part of what AI knows?"

---

### SLIDE 4: THE PROBLEM
**Duration:** 25 seconds
**Visual:** Lonely website floating in space, disconnected

**Text on Screen:**
> If your only online presence is your website...
> AI doesn't know you exist.
> 
> Your website = 1 voice saying "I'm great"
> AI needs: Multiple trusted sources confirming you're real

**Narration:**
"If your entire online presence is a standalone website and maybe a Google Business profile... AI doesn't know you exist. Your website is one voice saying 'I'm great.' Everyone's website says that. AI needs multiple trusted sources confirming you're real, you're good, you're active."

---

### SLIDE 5: THE OPPORTUNITY
**Duration:** 30 seconds
**Visual:** Business connected to multiple nodes—News, Directory, Events, Community—all feeding into "AI Knows You"

**Text on Screen:**
> Be in the sources AI trusts:
> • Local news publications
> • Business directories
> • Event calendars
> • Community platforms
>
> One presence. Multiple touchpoints. AI-discoverable.

**Narration:**
"The opportunity is to be present in the sources AI trusts. Local news. Business directories. Event calendars. Community platforms. When you're in multiple authoritative sources, AI sees you as real, trusted, recommendable.

And here's the best part: you don't have to build this yourself. The infrastructure already exists."

---

### SLIDE 6: CTA
**Duration:** 15 seconds
**Visual:** Clean design with two buttons

**Text on Screen:**
> Want the full picture?
>
> [Download the Full Article]
> Real stories. Deeper insights. How to take action.
>
> [Skip to the How-To Guide]
> Ready to implement? Start here.

**Narration:**
"Want the full picture? Download the article—it's got real stories, deeper insights, and exactly what to do next. Or if you're ready to take action now, skip straight to the how-to guide. Either way, you're two minutes closer to being found."

### [ARTICLE BEGINS]

# The Day Martinez Plumbing Disappeared

**How a 30-year business became invisible overnight—and what it means for yours**

---

Roberto Martinez had been a plumber for 31 years. His father started the business. His son was learning the trade. Three generations of Martinez Plumbing, serving the same community since 1993.

They had a good reputation. Referrals kept them busy. When the internet came along, Roberto's daughter built them a website. When Google Business became a thing, she set that up too. Five stars, dozens of reviews. They were doing fine.

Then, last spring, Roberto noticed something strange.

"The phone stopped ringing from new customers," he told me. "I mean, regulars still called. People who knew us. But new people? Nothing. For weeks."

His daughter checked their Google ranking. Still there. Still five stars. Still showing up when you searched "plumber near me."

So what happened?

---

### The Shift Nobody Warned Them About

Here's what Roberto didn't know: the way people find local businesses changed. And it changed fast.

His daughter made a discovery when she asked her teenage son to find a plumber for his apartment.

"He didn't Google it," she told me. "He asked ChatGPT. He literally said, 'Hey, find me a reliable plumber in [their city].' And ChatGPT gave him three names. We weren't one of them."

She tried it herself. Asked her phone's AI assistant. Asked ChatGPT. Asked Perplexity. Asked Claude.

Martinez Plumbing—31 years, five stars, great reputation—didn't exist in any of the answers.

"It was like we just... weren't there," Roberto said. "Thirty years, and the AI didn't know we existed."

---

### How AI "Knows" Things

Here's what most business owners don't understand about AI assistants—the thing that explains exactly what happened to Martinez Plumbing.

AI doesn't search the internet in real-time like Google does. AI has already learned things. It's been trained on data. It has a "knowledge base" that it draws from when you ask questions.

When someone asks, "Who's a good plumber in Springfield?"—the AI doesn't go searching. The AI already has an answer based on what it's learned.

So what has it learned? Where does that knowledge come from?

**AI learns from authoritative sources:**
- News publications and local media
- Established business directories
- Review platforms with verified data
- Active businesses with recent information

**AI trusts consistency:**
- The same business showing up across multiple sources
- Consistent name, address, services
- Multiple signals all saying "this business is real and good"

**AI values freshness:**
- Recent activity signals a living business
- Stale information suggests maybe they've closed
- Events, news mentions, current reviews all matter

Martinez Plumbing had a website and a Google Business profile. That's it. Two data points. No news mentions. No directory listings beyond Google. No events. No community presence.

From AI's perspective, they were practically invisible.

---

### The Businesses AI Recommends

Meanwhile, a competing plumbing company—one that had been around only eight years—was showing up in every AI recommendation.

Why? I looked into it.

They were listed in the local business directory. They had been mentioned in a local news article about home improvement tips. They posted community events (a free "winterize your pipes" workshop). They were active on the local community platform.

They weren't bigger than Martinez. They weren't better. They weren't cheaper.

They were just *visible* in the places AI looks.

"Same service, probably same quality," Roberto admitted. "But they're getting the calls. Because the AI knows they exist."

---

### This Isn't About Google Anymore

For twenty years, the game was Google. Rank on Google, get found on Google, pay Google for ads. Businesses spent fortunes on SEO, on Google Ads, on gaming the algorithm.

That game is ending.

Google's own data shows that younger users are increasingly using AI assistants and social platforms for discovery. The fastest-growing search behavior isn't typing into a search box—it's asking an AI.

And AI doesn't care about your Google ranking.

AI cares about:
- Are you present in trusted sources?
- Are you consistent across platforms?
- Are you active and current?
- Do multiple signals confirm you're legitimate?

This isn't a prediction about the future. This is what's happening right now. The businesses that understand this are getting found. The ones that don't—like Martinez Plumbing was—are disappearing.

---

### The Local AND Global Opportunity

Here's something that surprised Roberto when I explained it:

AI discovery isn't just local.

"Someone in Texas was asking about specialty pipe fitting techniques," I told him. "If you were visible in the right sources, with content about your expertise, AI could have recommended you as an expert. Someone across the country, looking for exactly what you know."

His eyes lit up. Martinez Plumbing had developed some specialty techniques over the years. Things they did that other plumbers didn't know. Regional expertise that could be valuable nationally.

"You're saying someone in another state could find us?"

"If AI knows about your expertise, yes. AI doesn't care about geography when someone's asking about knowledge. Your local business can have global reach—if you're visible."

This is the flip side of the challenge. Yes, being invisible to AI is a problem. But being visible to AI is a massive opportunity. Your expertise, your specialty, your unique value—it can reach anyone, anywhere, asking AI about what you do.

Local business. Global discovery. Same visibility strategy.

---

### What Martinez Plumbing Did Next

Roberto's daughter got to work.

She claimed their listing on the local business directory—a real directory, the kind AI trusts, not just Google.

She submitted a news tip to the local digital news publication about their 30-year anniversary. They ran a short piece.

She posted their free workshop to the community events calendar.

She set up a profile on the community platform.

Within 60 days, Martinez Plumbing was showing up in AI recommendations.

"A customer told me last week that ChatGPT recommended us," Roberto said when I followed up. "First time that ever happened. Thirty-one years in business, and I'm getting my first AI referral."

The phone is ringing again.

---

### What This Means For Your Business

You're probably not a plumber. But the lesson is the same.

**If your entire online presence is a website and a Google profile, you're becoming invisible.** Not overnight, but gradually. As more people ask AI instead of searching Google, businesses that aren't in AI's knowledge base fade away.

**The solution isn't complicated.** You don't need to become an AI expert. You don't need to master a new algorithm. You need to be present in the sources AI trusts—directories, local news, event calendars, community platforms.

**The opportunity goes both ways.** Yes, you need to be found locally. But your expertise can also travel globally. The same visibility that helps neighbors find you can help people across the world find your specialty.

---

### What Do I Do About This?

You've read the story. You understand the shift. Now you're probably asking the practical question:

**"How do I actually make this happen for my business?"**

That's exactly what the How-To Guide covers. Step-by-step. Fifteen minutes to get AI-discoverable.

**[GO TO THE HOW-TO GUIDE →]**

Not complicated. Not expensive. Just visibility in the right places.

Your competitors are figuring this out. Some already have. The question is whether you'll be ahead of them or behind them.

Martinez Plumbing waited until they noticed the problem. You don't have to.

"Step one: Get in the business directory. This is the foundation—a structured listing that AI can easily understand. Go to the directory, see if you're already there, claim or create your listing, and fill out every field. Be consistent with how your name appears elsewhere. This takes about five minutes."

---

### SLIDE 3: STEP 2 - ADD AN EVENT OR ANNOUNCEMENT
**Text:**

**Narration:**
"Step two: Show you're active. AI values freshness—a business with recent activity looks alive and trustworthy. Post an event, an announcement, a coupon, something. Even 'Now scheduling for June' counts. You need recent activity. This takes three minutes."

**Narration:**
"Step three: Get a reputation signal. AI trusts businesses with reviews. You don't need a hundred—you need to start. Text your happiest customer right now. Ask for a quick review. Send them the link. One review today beats waiting for reviews to trickle in."
