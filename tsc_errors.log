src/services/realtime.ts(87,21): error TS2352: Conversion of type '{ listen: (ev: string, cb: (e: unknown) => void) => void; }' to type '{ stopListening: (ev: string) => void; }' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Property 'stopListening' is missing in type '{ listen: (ev: string, cb: (e: unknown) => void) => void; }' but required in type '{ stopListening: (ev: string) => void; }'.
