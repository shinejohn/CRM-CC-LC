## ⚠️ Important Note

**The backend API isn't deployed yet**, so:
- Some API calls will fail (expected)
- The UI will still load and you can see all pages
- Navigation works perfectly
- You can test the interface

**This is normal - the UI is fully viewable!**

---

## 🛑 To Stop

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

---

**That's it! Run `npm install` then `npm run dev`** 🎉
