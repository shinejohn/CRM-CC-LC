# ✅ 403 Error Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **Origin Updated** - Now uses S3 REST API endpoint (`s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`)
2. ✅ **OAI Configured** - Origin Access Identity is properly set up
3. ✅ **Bucket Policy** - Allows CloudFront OAI access
4. ✅ **Cache Invalidated** - CloudFront cache cleared
5. ✅ **Distribution Deployed** - Status: Deployed

The distribution has been updated. It may take 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate globally.

**If you still see 403:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for CloudFront to propagate
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Try in incognito/private mode

## ✅ Configuration Verified

- ✅ Origin: `s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` (correct)
- ✅ OAI: `origin-access-identity/cloudfront/E872XM8XJNH3Z`
- ✅ Bucket Policy: Allows OAI access
- ✅ Files: Deployed to S3

**Everything is configured correctly!** 🎉
