## 🔑 WHAT I NEED (Choose ONE Option)

### Option 1: Railway Login Credentials ⚡ FASTEST

### Option 2: Railway API Token 🔐 MOST SECURE
**What:** Generate API token from Railway dashboard

**You do:**
1. Go to: https://railway.app/account/tokens

### Option 3: You Create Services, I Configure 🎯 HYBRID (Recommended)
**What:** You create Railway services, share connection strings  
**Time:** 1 hour (you: 15 min, me: 45 min)  
**Best for:** You want control over Railway dashboard

**You do (15 minutes):**
1. Create Railway account (if needed)
2. Create new project: `CRM-CC-LC`

4. Add Redis service
5. Share connection strings OR just confirm created

**I do (45 minutes):**

### Option 4: I Create Code First, You Deploy Later 📝 SLOWEST

**Time:** 2 hours (you do deployment later)  
**Best for:** You want to see code first

**I do now:**
- ✅ Create backend Laravel structure
- ✅ Create Railway config files
- ✅ Convert database migrations
- ✅ Prepare everything

**You do later:**

---

## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Option 3 (Hybrid)** is best because:
- ✅ You maintain control of Railway account
- ✅ I handle all technical setup
- ✅ Fast (1 hour total)
- ✅ You can review before deployment

**OR**

**Option 2 (API Token)** if you prefer:
- ✅ Most secure (one-time token)
- ✅ Fast (30 minutes)
- ✅ I can set up everything

## 💡 QUICK ANSWER

**What's easiest for you?**

1. **"Share Railway login"** → I set up everything in 30 min
2. **"Generate API token"** → You create token, I set up in 30 min
