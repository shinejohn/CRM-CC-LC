## 💡 MEANWHILE...

**I'm creating the backend code structure now** (doesn't need Railway access):
- ✅ Laravel backend directory
- ✅ Railway config files
- ✅ Database migrations

**Once you're authenticated, I'll:**
- Connect everything
- Create Railway services
- Set up deployment

**Just run `railway login` when ready!** 🚂
